Newshound
========

by Debbie Cravey

Newshound is a program that allows a newspaper to keep track of its specialized reporting divisions or "beats" and the reporters assigned to those beats.

* The newspaper owner is able to add "beats" to the webpage.
* The newspaper owner is able to add reporters' name, years of employment and birthday to a particular beat.
* The website then displays the beats with the reporters listed by name.
* The newspaper owner is also able to filter or search the beats.
* The newspaper owner can click on a reporter and see all of the details about that reporter.
